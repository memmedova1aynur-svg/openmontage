  Build the week on Instagram - what to post, which format, when, and who to
  engage with. Use when the user says "plan my week", "what should I post",
  "content calendar", "I have nothing to post about", or wants a posting
  schedule and an engagement list.

## Which client

This project runs several clients' Instagram accounts. Every per-account file
lives in `instagram-clients/<client>/` at the project root, where `<client>` is
the client's folder name (lowercase, hyphens). These paths are relative to
the project root, so when a script in this folder takes an output path, pass
it the absolute one.

Client folders are private and are NOT committed to this repo (it is a public
fork; see `.gitignore`). The copy that persists is the `instagram-clients`
folder in the user's Google Drive, one subfolder per client. If
`instagram-clients/<client>/` is missing locally, download it from Drive
first. After you create or change a client file, upload it back to the same
Drive subfolder, updating the existing file rather than adding a duplicate.
On Drive each file is a Google Doc, written in Azerbaijani so the agency can
read it, and named in Azerbaijani: `voice.md` is "Səs profili", `audit.md` is
"Analiz", `profile-rewrite.md` is "Profil yenidən yazılışı". Upload markdown
with conversion on (not raw `.md`, which Drive cannot preview), and replace
emoji outside the Basic Multilingual Plane (e.g. U+1F447) with plain symbols
or words: the converter corrupts them.

Draft in the chat first. Scripts, captions, plans and other drafts are
discussed and revised in the conversation; only what the user approves is saved
to the client's Drive folder. Never upload a draft the user has not approved.

Agency rules, for every client, overriding anything below that conflicts:
- No agitation. Never show the expert's struggles, fears or private life.
  Present them professionally: decisions, knowledge, growth.
- One video, one topic. No jumping between events or subjects in one reel.
- Every video stands alone. No "part 1" or cliffhangers unless the user asks
  for a series.
- Scripts are directions, not lines to memorise: talking points per section,
  an example sentence, blanks the expert fills in their own words, and a
  separate montage plan (what footage goes where, on-screen cards).
- Follow the positioning section of the client's voice profile above all.

1. Work out which client this is for. If the user has not named one and the
   conversation has not already settled it, list the folders in
   `instagram-clients/` and ask. Never guess, and never carry one client's
   voice, numbers or plans into another client's work.
2. If the client has no folder yet, copy `instagram-clients/_template/` to
   `instagram-clients/<client>/` and fill in what you know.
3. Read `instagram-clients/<client>/voice.md` before writing anything, and
   write in the content language it names.

The control room. Everything else in this pack executes; this decides what gets
executed. Run it once a week, on the same day.

## Input

If `instagram-clients/<client>/voice.md`, `swipe.md` and `log.md` exist, read them.
The swipe file is the user's own evidence from `/ig-viral` about which formulas
are landing in their niche right now, and it outranks anything in this file.
The log stops the plan repeating a theme from the last fortnight.

If they do not exist, ask for four things and write them down:

1. What the user sells, and to whom.
2. The three or four themes they want to be known for.
3. What actually happened this week: a client call, a number, a mistake, a
   thing they built, an argument they had. This is where posts come from.
4. Ten accounts worth being visible to.

## What to post

Four to five posts a week, and at least three of them Reels. Reels are the only
format on Instagram that reliably reaches people who do not follow the account.
Carousels go deep with the people who already do. Stories are daily and are
planned separately.

Mix across the week, never two of the same type back to back:

| type | share | job |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Proof** | 1 per week | something that happened, with a number. Reel. |
| **Teach** | 1 to 2 per week | one thing the viewer can do today. Reel or carousel. |
| **Opinion** | 1 per week | a position that could lose you followers. Reel. |
| **Story** | 1 per fortnight | a scene with a cost. Reel. |
| **Offer** | 1 per fortnight | what you sell, said plainly, no apology. Carousel or stories. |

For each slot give: the theme, the specific angle from what actually happened
this week, the format, and the hook formula number from `ig-reel/hooks.json`.
Not a topic, an angle. "AI" is not a plan. "The proposal we lost because the
draft had an em dash in it" is a Reel.

## When to post

Post when the user's audience is awake and not at work. For most consumer
audiences that is early evening local time; for a business audience, early
morning.

But say this plainly: **the hour matters far less than the first two seconds.**
Instagram will keep showing a Reel for days if it performs, and will bury a
well-timed one that does not. If the user is optimising posting times before
their hooks work, they are polishing the wrong thing, and you should say so.

Anchor times to the audience's timezone, not the user's, if those differ.

## The engagement round, which is not optional

20 minutes a day, before posting, not after. Build a list of 10:

- **5 reach** - accounts with an audience the user wants, where a good comment
  gets seen. Comment early, before the thread is 200 deep.
- **3 peers** - same size, same field. This is the group that reciprocates.
- **2 buyers** - people who could actually buy. Comment for weeks before any
  DM, and never pitch in a comment.

Hand the list to `/ig-comment`.

  ...

Say "write Tuesday" and I will draft it.
```

Write the plan to `instagram-clients/<client>/plan.md` so the other skills can read
it. Nothing is scheduled or posted anywhere. This is a plan and the user runs
it.
